Feature: create movie

    As a rottenpotatoes user
    So that i can properly manage the list of movies
    I want to be able to create a movie

Background: movies in database

  Given the following movies exist:
  | title        | rating | director     | release_date |
  | Star Wars    | PG     | George Lucas |   1977-05-25 |
  | Blade Runner | PG     | Ridley Scott |   1982-06-25 |
  | Alien        | R      |              |   1979-05-25 |
  | THX-1138     | R      | George Lucas |   1971-03-11 |


Scenario: creating a new movie
    When I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
    And I follow "Add new movie"
    And I fill in "Title" with "Test Movie"
    And I select "PG-13" from "Rating"
    And I select "2021" from "movie_release_date_1i"
    And I select "August" from "movie_release_date_2i"
    And I select "1" from "movie_release_date_3i"
    And I press "Save Changes"
    Then I should see "Test Movie was successfully created."
    And I should see "PG-13"
    And I should see "2021-08-01"
